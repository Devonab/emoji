It's an open-source project which permits you to copy easily an emoji (it's an emoji picker, basically).
You can search by keywords or use the "most used emojis". Or just looking for the perfect emoji navigating in the sections.

You can customise the addon, in fact you can enable or disable various options, which make the addon personal and unique!

You can use the shortcut: Ctrl+Alt+A on Windows and Linux and Cmd+Alt+A on macOS.

Some information about fonts used in the app:
- The main font and, in my opinion, the most beautiful one is Twemoji, developed by Twitter. You can read more about it for free (it's also open-source!) here: https://twemoji.twitter.com/

- OpenMoji, which is my second favourite emoji-font. Read more here: https://openmoji.org/

- Noto sans, by Google. Read more here: https://www.google.com/get/noto/help/emoji/

Other fonts, like "OS emoji font" depends by your OS settings, so you should see them licences.
